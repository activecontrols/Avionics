# Avionics
This was an attempt at multithreading at Teensy 4.1. The inital step was checking multithreading using teensythreading library. The first step was to check this using LEDs with the teensy and lights on a breadboard. The code sucessfully do that (this part is commented out). After that the delay functioon was added. This was done to check if multithreading works and if certain functions can be delayed accordingly to the time it takes for them to run. All this is in the light.ino file. The next step to lock the volatile variables that will be shared in the 2 functions. This will most probably be done using muxes or a mux lock. Some information about this is in the teensythread library.
